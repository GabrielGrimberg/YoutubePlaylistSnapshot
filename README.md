No worries, **YoutubePlaylistSnapshot.py** will save all of your playlist videos in a text file so you will know which one(s) was removed from YouTube.

### Usage
Do "*YoutubePlaylistSnapshot.py -h*" for help.
  
### Example Usage
Say you want to take a snapshot of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRh_vgS2dFE&list=PLDcnymzs18LVXfO_x0Ei0R24qDbVtyy66

And we also want to save each video uploader's name and the date of when the video was added to the playlist:

*YoutubePlaylistSnapshot.py -dt -un PLDcnymzs18LVXfO_x0Ei0R24qDbVtyy66*
